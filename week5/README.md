# Angular

#### What's a framework?
a framework is a simplification of a language and/or design pattern to a foundation for developers to use to build apps with ease.

## What's Angular?
- It is an open-source TypScript-based frontend framework developed by Google (in 2010).
- It uses a component structure that represents a view on a webpage
- We use Angular to create SPA's (Single Page Applications)
    - SPA's allow for faster and more responsive web pages and a better user-experience

### History of Angular
- Created in 2010 as AngularJS
- Then in 2016 it was rewritten to support TypeScript and Angular 2 was released
- About every 6 months a new version of Angular is released
- We will use Angular 11.

### What makes an Angular app?
- **TypeScript** framework developed and maintained by Google.
- Reusbale code through the inclusion of **modules**
- Dynamics views through the usage of **components** and **templates**
- DOM manipulation is handled through **Directives**
- Single-page applications are created through the use of **Routing**
- Handle **Dependency Injection** through the use of **Services**

## TypeScript
- it is open-source and inveted by Microsoft
- it is a super-set of JS
- it is **strictly typed**
- Browsers themselves cannot interpret TS, so it must be **transpiled into JS**.
    > This is done with the TypeScropt compiler (tsc).
- It has syntax closer to higher level languages like Java, therfore it gives us compilation errors.

## Node JS
- It is a JS interpreter/server environment that allows us to run JS outside of the browser.

### What is NPM?
- Node Package Manager
- It is included in the download of Node.js and consists of a CLI (Command Line Interface) that interacts with a remote registry
- Similar to maven, it can manage dependencies and versions
    - This is done through the `package.json` file (which acts like the `pom.xml`).

### Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)
- This is the CLI that is used to scaffold and build the Angular Project using modules
- `ng` is the Angular command for the CLI
- to install Angualar, we call `npm install -g @angular/cli`

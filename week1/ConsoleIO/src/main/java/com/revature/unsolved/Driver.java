*
* BRIEF //
*
*   Your firm is implementing its student management prototype in Java.
*   It's a command-line program, which the registrar's office will use to
*   add students to the database upon enrollment.
*
*   The program should prompt the user for a student's first name; last name;
*   middle initial; physical address; email address; and phone number.
*	
*   After each prompt, the program should wait for the user's input. 
*
*   Once the user has entered every piece of information, the program should
*   print it all back to the console, and prompt the user to enter Y if the
*   information is correct, or any other key otherwise.
*
*   For now, you should collect the user's response--i.e., y or otherwise--but
*   don't worry about handling it. We'll get to that shortly.
*

		/*
		 * 3. Once you're gotten all the information, print the value
		 * of each variable.  Use String.format() %s to indicate a String substitution.

		/*
		 * 4. Finally, print a message asking the user if this is correct information.
		 * Collect their reponse in a varibale called confirmation....BUT DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH THIS VARIABLE.

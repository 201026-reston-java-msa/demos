        overall category-->

        <p>This is a paragraph, used to display lots of text.
            Generally, HTML will ignore large whitespaces, expect for defined spaces.







            I have put blank lines above.  Let's see what happens.

        <!-- The above line is called a line break

    Since the paragraph tag IGNORES all whitespace, this is how
we get new lines.

    <h1>Semantic Tags</h1>
    <!--Semantic Tags are tags that are names in a specific way so that they are easier to read by humans.
    
    They help discern the intentions of the developer who wrote the HTML document-->

    <!-- Note that they are not very different from regular tags, they just aim to more clearly specify the purpose of a segement of html
    Examples: header, footer, nav, article, etc. -->
    <header>
        <h2>I am a header</h2>
        <p>Usually this would be at the top of a webpage</p>
    </header>

    <footer>
        <h2>I am a footer</h2>
        <p>Usually this would be at the bottom of a webpage</p>
    </footer>

    <!-- Nav is usually used to enclose a section that has links...You know...like a nav bar-->

    <nav>
        <h2>Navigate to these links</h2>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?va=b&t=hc">Duck Duck Go</a>

    <!--Attributes-->
    <!--
        An attribute is used to define a characteristic of an HTML element.

        - Attributes are placed WITHIN an element's opening tag
        - All attributes are composed of 2 parts: name & value
            + the name is thr property that you want to set
            + The values is what you want the property to be set to.

    <p align="left">This paragraph is left aligned</p>
    <p align="center">This paragraph is center aligned</p>
    <p align="right">This paragraph is right aligned</p>

    <!--The title attributte gives a suggested title for the element-->
    <h4 title="This is my first attribute!">Hover over me!</h4>

    <h3>The ID Attribute</h3>
    <!-- The id attribute of an html tag can be used to uniquely identiy that tag within an html page 
    
    There are 2 main reasons why you would use an id

        1. If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify JUST that element and its content for use in things like JavaScript
    
        2. If you have 2 elements of the same name within a web page, you can distinguish between them-->

    <p id="id1">This paragraph talks about html</p>
    <p id="id2">This paragraph talks about CSS</p>

    <h2>The Style Attribute</h2>
    <!-- The style attrbiute can of course be used to style individual elemenets in misc ways such as coloring the text, the text background or changing the font, and many others-->
    </body>

    <p style="font-family: wingdings; color:greenyellow; background-color: lightslategrey;">Some special text</p>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:greenyellow; background-color: lightslategrey;">Some special text (translated from wingdings)</p>

    <h2>HTML Forms</h2>
    <form action=""> <!--Action describes what you want to do with the input information-->
        Username: <input type="text" name="username"/>
        <br />
        <br />
        Password: <input type="password" name="password"/>
        <br />
        <input type="radio" name="yes" unchecked> Yes!
        <br />
        <!-- Radios of the same name allow only one of them to be checked at the same time-->
        <input type="radio" name="yes" unchecked> A different Yes!
        <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="no" unchecked> No
        <br />
        <input type="checkbox" name="no" unchecked> Another No

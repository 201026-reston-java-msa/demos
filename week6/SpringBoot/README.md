# SpringBoot with Angular Demo
- The exported URL within our Angular application (within the `environment.prod.ts` and `environment.ts`) file to access our RESTful server is as follows:

```
export const environment = {
  production: true
};

export const HERO_URL = `http://localhost:8090/`;
```

The Angular application is that same as we created in our SpringMVCAngular demo which you can find [here](https://github.com/201026-reston-java-msa/demos/tree/main/week6/SpringMVCAngular/angular-hero).
